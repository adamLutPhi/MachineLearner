Life is a Set of random variables of `opportunities` 
[FYI: random Variable is 
1.Neither a Random: always follow a distribution
2. Nor a Variable: it is a function of Probability Density(_**me**:frequency_) 
]
the objective is to Utilze the most of it, in an _effective manner_ - __~90%__ of the time (_Almost Surely_) 

### ðŸŽ® Mixed-Coding mode
**1.Focus**
The best learning is that One where pushing thyself, to face off Poly-shaped, Spaghetti monster- (like this one) 

**2.Relax**
Space in mind, for relaxation.
Early _signs_ of that: 
- Once `Creativity` starts lacking, - when new ideas become `transparent` 
- `Novelity` vanishes into thin air, & Cloud of Routine takes over, its shadows become in everywhere you go  that's when it Hovers over 

## what I'm learning with this project

- [x]  Use an [acceptable] RNG (Random Number Generator) ( `StableRNG`)

- [ ] How to build A NeuralNetwork Model?

- [ ] Which differentiation Module to Pick?
*Thinking about it* ðŸ¤”

## Lessons learned 

- `Ziggurat function` is **Biased** in Data Sampling. Samples are More around the mean, but there aren't as much are  the `Tail Area`. An Ideal sampler would `Uniformly Samples` (on x-Axis), regardless the Distribution & its respective properties  (for that reason, I don't see it as an enhancement). _Alas_, to Cross-reference with another paper (yet to come) that studies Tails, & proves this algorithm is sound, & Fairly Samples data in tail, just as everywhere else

- A Fair Sampler is expected to work, which Starts sampling from a Uniform locations along the x-Axis - whatever Distribution might be considered 

- Opens up a _possibility_ for a **Statistical Repo**

# A WIP (Work In Progress) Project
This project is just a `seed` I sowed
(If you want a final produce, Please check back later)
<br/>
This repo is on a  `Social Network`
If you'd like to  give a `hand`,
Please **step** in the Scene
Your Help would be much `Appreciated`-  Thank you
(though the High of `Figuring things Out` remains tempting
