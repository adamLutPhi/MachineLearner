Life is a Set of random variables of `opportunities` 
[FYI: random Variable is 
1.Neither a Random: always follow a distribution
2. Nor a Variable: it is a function of Probability Density(_**me**:frequency_) 
]
the objective is to Utilze the most of it, in an _effective manner_ - __~90%__ of the time (_Almost Surely_) 

### ðŸŽ® Mixed-Coding mode
**1.Focus**
The best learning is that One where pushing thyself, to face off Poly-shaped, Spaghetti monster- (like this one) 

**2.Relax**
Space in mind, for relaxation.
Early _signs_ of that: 
- Once `Creativity` starts lacking, - when new ideas become `transparent` 
- `Novelity` vanishes into thin air, & Cloud of Routine takes over, its shadows become in everywhere you go  that's when it Hovers over 

## what I'm learning with this project

- [x]  Use an [acceptable] RNG (Random Number Generator) ( `StableRNG`)

- [ ] How to build A NeuralNetwork Model?

- [ ] Which differentiation Module to Pick?
*Thinking about it* ðŸ¤”

## Lessons learned 

- `Ziggurat function` is a **Biased** Data Sampler. Samples are More around the Mean, whereas an Ideal  Sampler would fairly 
but there aren't as much are  the `Tail Area`. An Ideal sampler would `Uniformly Samples` (on x-Axis), regardless the Distribution & its respective properties  (for that reason, I don't see it as an enhancement). _Alas_, to Cross-reference with another paper (yet to come) that studies Tails, & proves this algorithm is sound, & Fairly Samples data in tail, just as everywhere else

- Opens up a _possibility_ for a **Statistical Repo**

# Credits

## Special Thanks
to the Heros behind the Scene; a list of Human Beings, in which I couldn't do this project without, 
in the Alphabetic Order:

- Professor `Steven G. Johnson` @stevengj: providing an `MIT OCW [18.335J / 6.337J](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-335j-introduction-to-numerical-methods-spring-2019/)`  Julia course (usefully Concise Course)on github
- Tamas K. Paap [PhD] @tpapp: Useful Code Help  on the `Julia Discourse` 
- Professor `Tim Holy` (Physics): Arrays (as featured, in  [juliacon2016 Keynote - an overview of Arrays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl0g9tHeghA))

## Papers Used 

-The Ziggurat paper: `A modified ziggurat algorithm for generating exponentially and
normally distributed pseudorandom numbers` (including the author's view on the [Tail generation issue](https://github.com/adamwillisXanax/DeepLearner/discussions/12))

Please Review paper,on p.3:
>We do not improve upon these approaches here and, instead, reuse previous techniques
>...
>Overall, the ZA is ideal for distributions
>with Infrequent Sampling from the tail, i.e. not heavy-tailed distributions.

Paper on citeseer [from here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4812161/pdf/nihms-717849.pdf)

A modified ziggurat algorithm for generating exponentially- and
normally-distributed pseudorandom numbers
## Youtube
Personally, the best Neural Network course, easily Explained by a Humble `Prof. S. Sengupta`, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbYgKoG4x2g&list=PL53BE265CE4A6C056)
# A WIP (Work In Progress) Project
This project is just a `seed` I sowed
(If you want a final produce, Please check back later)
<br/>
This repo is on a  `Social Network`
If you'd like to  give a `hand`,
Please **step in**; Your Help would be much `Appreciated`-  Thank you
(though the High of `Figuring things Out` has a mesmerizing remains tempting)
