# Machine Learner

A `Machine Learning` Repository, and its algorithms

"Life is a Set of random variables of `opportunities`"

- A random Variable is:

1. Neither a Random: always follow a `distribution`
2. Nor a Variable: it is a function of `Probability Density` (i.e. _frequency_)

the objective is to Utilize the most of it, _effectively_- **~90%** of the time

### üéÆ Mixed-Coding mode

**1. Focused**
The best learning is the One where pushing, to face off the Poly-shaped, Spaghetti monster complexity (like this one)

**2. Relaxed**  
keep Space in mind, call for relaxation, when Early _signs_ :

- Once `Creativity` starts lacking, - new ideas become `transparent`
- `Novelity` vanishes into thin air, & Cloud of Routine takes over (its shadows become in everywhere you go)

## Currently learning

- [x] Use an RNG (Random Number Generator) (`StableRNG`)

- [ ] Application of `Divide & Conquer` Algorithm (see Repository: [Cause & Effect](https://github.com/adamwillisMastery/CauseEffect) )

### Machine Learning Algorithms

- [x] Outline a `widrowHoff` Algorithm 
- [x] Outline a `Green's function` Algorithm
      
### Open Questions

- [ ] How to build A Neural-Network Model (Learning algorithm, Error function `erf`, optimization)
- [ ] Which differentiation Module to Pick? ü§î
- [ ] How could we implement an Optimization function?

## Special Thanks

to the Heroes behind the Scene, a list of Human Beings, & tutors, in which I couldn't do this project without,
in the Alphabetic Order:

- Professor `Steven G. Johnson` [@stevengj](https://github.com/stevengj): providing an MIT OCW `Introduction to Numerical Methods` [18.335J / 6.337J](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-335j-introduction-to-numerical-methods-spring-2019/) Julia course (usefully Concise Course) on [GitHub](https://github.com/mitmath/18335/tree/spring19)
- `Tamas K. Papp [PhD]` [@tpapp](https://github.com/tpapp): Useful Code Help on the `Julia Discourse`
- `Professor Tim Holy` (Neuroscience) [@timholy](https://github.com/timholy): help with Arrays (& Holmes) (as featured, in [juliacon2016 Keynote - an overview of Arrays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl0g9tHeghA))

## Lessons learned

1. [the Ziggurat Function](https://github.com/adamwillisMastery/DeepLearner/discussions/12#discussioncomment-4287803)



- Opens up the _possibility_ for a **Statistical Repo** üí°

## Papers Used

-[The Ziggurat paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6870), by Christopher D McFarland : `A Modified Ziggurat Algorithm for Generating Exponentially and
Normally Distributed Pseudorandom Numbers` (including the author's view on the [Tail generation issue](https://github.com/adamwillisXanax/DeepLearner/discussions/12))

Good points of this paper is: it does not use `rejection regions` (what makes it Interesting for application) _(Please Review on p.3, if you will)_
>We do not improve upon these approaches here and, instead, _reuse previous techniques_
>...
>Overall, the ZA is ideal for distributions
>_with Infrequent Sampling from the tail_, i.e. **not heavy-tailed distributions.**

**Paper on could be found _[from here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4812161/pdf/nihms-717849.pdf)_**

## WIP (Work In Progress Project)

This project is a Sown `seed` in the ground üå±

If you do not mind, have free time, can help & give a `hand` ü§ù
Please **step in**: Your Help would be much `Appreciated`- **_Thank You_** üôè
