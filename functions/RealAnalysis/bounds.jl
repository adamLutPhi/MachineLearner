Supremum function

The supremum of a set is its least upper bound and the infimum is its greatest upper bound. Definition 2.2. Suppose that A ⊂ R is a set of real numbers. If M ∈ R is an upper bound of A such that M ≤ M′ for every upper bound M′ of A, then M is called the supremum of A,
 denoted M = sup A.
