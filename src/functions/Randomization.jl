#=Chaos Randomization 
nickhigham juliacon 2018



here's another idea, Randomization, useful & simple 
 
#Chaoscarries on explaining chaos in his own words:
sth nasty happens ()
in order to avoid that by adding extra noise to the Problem
(in other words we explain deterministic chaos i.e. noise )
@23:05
try to avoid tricky cases (i thought we're modelling chaos!)

1. (it) breaks down when A is not Diagonalizable [tested, spot-on]
Numericall Unstable when A has Nearly Defective 

Point:(you have to ) Understand how it words (in addition to having)
theoretical Understanding (of what you gonna get )
(if you do add noise to the problem)

Example: matrix functions 
given n x m matrix A

A = Xdiag(λi)*X^-1 => f(A) = X*diag(f(λi))*X^-1
if A is Diagonalizable [positive, squared]
I could compute Eigen Decomposition 

lambda is 

if that was possible, then f()

    -eigen values stay the same multiply out 

    put things better again 
    given Diagonalization 
    you can gen any function (in the matrix)

        Example: the exponential 
        or the square root
