those are testable:
pwd()
projectDirectory= dirname(pwd()) #projectDirectory
homeDirectory = homedir()
appDirectory = @__DIR__ #ideal root node to navigate from
constraintsLoc = "src/constants.jl"
directory = appDirectory * "/" * constraintsLoc

the Plan:
#1. need to go up , 2 directories [exactly]

cd("../..")
=#
include("../../constants.jl") #seems correct directory - works as expected (on mac os)- seems fine on windows too
